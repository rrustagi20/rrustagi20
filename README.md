### Hi Folks ðŸ‘‹


<!-- **rrustagi20/rrustagi20** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

<!-- Here are some ideas to get you started: -->
I am a master's student at Georgia Tech working in robotics and perception advised by Dr. Sonia Chernova. I recently graduated from IIT Kanpur with a Major in Aerospace Engineering with Minors in Machine Learning and Computer Systems. 

I have been a keen Aerial Robotics enthusiast working on ROS systems and implementing ML/DL/RL applications on flight computer GPUs for real time in-flight operations. Had a great opportunity to be part of the VTOL Laboratory at IIT Kanpur and publish papers.

Currenlty looking for opportunities to explore embedded programming implementations and software side robotics projects. Hit me up at rustagirahul24@gmail.com for any possible collaborations.

Happy Roboting :)
