### Hi Folks 👋


<!-- **rrustagi20/rrustagi20** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

<!-- Here are some ideas to get you started: -->
I am a master's student at Georgia Tech working in robotics and perception advised by Dr. Glen Chou. I received my Bachelors from IIT Kanpur with a Major in Aerospace Engineering and Minors in Computer Science and Machine Learning. 

I have been a Robotics enthusiast working on ROS systems and optimizing foundational models for real time robotic application. I have build upon my optimization skills by being researcher at the VTOL Laboratory at IIT Kanpur and interest in embodied AI by working with Prof. Sonia Chernova at the RAIL Lab @ Georgia Tech.

Currenlty looking for full-time opportunities in the US starting May 2026 in robotics. Drop a message at rustagirahul24@gmail.com for any collaborations.

Happy Roboting :)
