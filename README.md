### Hi Folks ðŸ‘‹


<!-- **rrustagi20/rrustagi20** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

<!-- Here are some ideas to get you started: -->
Myself Rahul. I am an incoming student in MS. ECE at Georgia Institute of Technology starting Fall 2024. I recently graduated from IIT Kanpur with a Major in Aerospace Engineering with Minors in Machine Learning and Computer Systems. 

In my free time, I play guitar and listen to pop music while trying to make a cover :)

I have been a keen Aerial Robotics enthusiast working on ROS systems and implementing ML/DL/RL applications on flight computer GPUs for real time in-flight operations. Had a great opportunity to be part of the VTOL Laboratory at IIT Kanpur and publish papers.

Currenlty looking for opportunities to explore embedded programming implementations and software side robotics projects. Hit me up at rustagirahul24@gmail.com for any possible collaborations.

Happy Roboting :)
